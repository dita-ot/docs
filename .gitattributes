# Handle line endings per <http://help.github.com/line-endings/>

# Set the default behavior, in case `core.autocrlf` isnâ€™t set
# (auto-detect text files and perform LF normalization):
*       text=auto

# Normalize text files & convert to native line endings on checkout:
*.css   text
*.dita* text

*.bat   text eol=crlf
*.cmd   text eol=crlf

# Files that should always have UNIX LF line endings on checkout:
