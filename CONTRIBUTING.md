# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the DITA-OT documentation. 

## Create an Issue

If you find a bug — _and you don’t know how to fix it_, [create an issue](https://github.com/dita-ot/docs/issues/new) to request changes.

Before you do that, [review the open issues](https://github.com/dita-ot/docs/issues) to make sure it hasn't already been reported.


_or — even better:_

## Create a Pull Request

If you know how to fix the issue yourself, that's great! Here's what to do:

1. [Fork the repository][1],
2. [Create a new branch][2], 
3. Make your changes on the new branch, and 
3. [Send a pull request][3]. 

### Always create a branch for your changes

The DITA-OT project uses the [Git Flow][4] branching strategy. 

In this model, change requests are tracked in feature branches that are created by branching off of the main development baseline in the `develop` branch. This makes it easier to keep track of related changes and merge them back into the development stream later. To find out more about how this works, see the [Gitflow Workflow][5] tutorial.

To send a pull request, create a feature branch in your fork with a name like `feature/my-changes`, make your changes on that branch in your fork and issue the pull request from there. 

For more information, see [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub][6].
