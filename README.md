# DITA Open Toolkit Documentation

This repository tracks the source files for the [DITA Open Toolkit documentation](http://dita-ot.github.io/2.0/). 


## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the DITA-OT documentation. 

To request changes, you can either [create a new issue](https://github.com/dita-ot/docs/issues/new), or â€” _even better_

1. [Fork the repository][1]
2. [Create a new branch][2], and 
3. [Send a pull request][3] 

The DITA-OT project uses the [Git Flow][4] branching strategy. 

In this model, change requests are tracked in feature branches that are created by branching off of the main development baseline in the `develop` branch. This makes it easier to keep track of related changes and merge them back into the development stream later.

If you'd like to send a pull request, create a feature branch in your fork with a name like `feature/my-proposed-changes` and issue the pull request from there.
