    <navtitle>Map-first preprocessing</navtitle>
  </titlealts>
  <shortdesc><ph id="map-first-preproc-desc">DITA-OT 2.5 introduces an experimental map-first preprocessing option as an
      alternative to the default <codeph>preprocess</codeph> operation. The new method provides the same functionality,
      but takes a different approach.</ph></shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p id="map-first-preproc-gain">Whereas the default preprocessing routine handles both maps and topics at the same
      time, the map-first approach begins by processing maps as far as possible, and only then starts processing topics.
      This simplifies the processing logic and creates cleaner module responsibilities, which makes it easier to process
      only those topics that are actually referenced after filtering, for example, or to only process the map to
      validate the map structure.</p>
    <p>The current preprocessing architecture was established during the DITA 1.0 era when there were fewer DITA
      features that operated on the map level. Initially, the difference between processing modes was not that great,
      but as more map-level features such as keys and key scopes have been added to DITA, processing maps first to build
      the context makes sense. The original preprocessing operation already does this to a degree, but the new map-first
      preprocessing option will be even more formal about it.</p>
    <note id="map-first-preproc-note">The map-first preprocessing option is not enabled by default in DITA-OT 2.5, but
      is offered as an experimental preview feature to allow users and vendors who extend preprocessing to provide
      feedback on possible issues with the design. The new option will most likely become the default in DITA-OT
      3.0.</note>
    <p>To use map-first preprocessing, call the <codeph>preprocess2</codeph> Ant target in your customizations instead
      of the default <codeph>preprocess</codeph> target.</p>
    <note type="attention">The <codeph>preprocess2</codeph> target name and implementation details are subject to
      change. Subject schemes and delayed key resolution have not yet been implemented, but support for at least subject
      schemes will likely be added in an upcoming release.</note>
