  <title>Extension points</title>
  <shortdesc>DITA Open Toolkit provides a series of extension points that can be used to integrate changes into the core
    code. Extension points are defined in the <filepath>plugin.xml</filepath> file for each plug-in. When plug-ins are
    installed, DITA-OT makes each extension visible to the rest of the toolkit.</shortdesc>
