  <title>HTML-based processing modules</title>
  <shortdesc>DITA-OT ships with several varieties of HTML output, each of which follows roughly the same path through
    the processing pipeline. All HTML-based transformations begin with the same call to the pre-processing module, after
    which they generate HTML files and then branch to create the transformation-specific navigation files.</shortdesc>
