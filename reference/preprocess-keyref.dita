  <title>Resolve key references (keyref)</title>
  <shortdesc>The <codeph>keyref</codeph> step examines all the keys that are defined in the DITA source and resolves the
    key references. Links that make use of keys are updated so that any <xmlatt>href </xmlatt>value is replaced by the
    appropriate target; key-based text replacement is also performed, and the key definition list file is written to the
    temporary directory. This step is implemented in Java.</shortdesc>
