  <title>Map based linking (maplink)</title>
  <shortdesc>This step collects links based on a map and moves those links into the referenced topics. The links are
    created based on hierarchy in the DITA map, the <xmlatt>collection-type</xmlatt> attribute, and relationship tables.
    This step is implemented in XSLT and Java.</shortdesc>

    <section>
      <p>The <codeph>maplink</codeph> module runs an XSLT stylesheet that evaluates the map; it places all the generated
        links into a single file in memory. The module then runs a Java program that pushes the generated links into the
        applicable topics.</p>
