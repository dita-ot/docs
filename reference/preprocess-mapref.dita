  <title>Resolve map references (mapref)</title>
  <shortdesc>The <codeph>mapref</codeph> step resolves references from one DITA map to another. This step is implemented
    in XSLT.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <section>
      <p>Maps reference other maps by using the following sorts of markup:
        <codeblock>&lt;topicref href="other.ditamap" format="ditamap"/>
...
&lt;mapref href="other.ditamap"/></codeblock></p>
      <p>As a result of the mapref step, the element that references another map is replaced by the topic references
        from the other map. Relationship tables are pulled into the referencing map as a child of the root element
          (<xmlelement>map</xmlelement> or a specialization of <xmlelement>map</xmlelement>). </p>
