  <title>Resolve topic fragments and code references (topic-fragment)</title>
  <shortdesc>The <codeph>topic-fragment</codeph> step expands content references to elements in the same topic and
    resolves references made with the <xmlelement>coderef</xmlelement> element. This step is implemented in SAX
    pipes.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <section>
      <p>Content references to elements in the same topic are defined via same-topic fragments such as
          <codeph>#./ID</codeph> in URIs.</p>
      <p>The <xmlelement>coderef</xmlelement> element is used to reference code stored externally in non-XML documents.
        During the pre-processing step, the referenced content is pulled into the containing
          <xmlelement>codeblock</xmlelement> element.</p>
