  <shortdesc>You install components to make them available for your solution.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Usually, you can install the components once and then forget about the details of this task. Before installing
      the components, you should make a plan for what you need to accomplish and the components that will support these
      goals. After installing the components, you will probably want to perform some preliminary configuration. </p>
