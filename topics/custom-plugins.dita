    various ways, add entirely new kinds of output formats, or implement DITA topic specializations.</shortdesc>

    <p>A plug-in consists of a directory, typically stored within the <filepath>plugins/</filepath> subdirectory of the
      DITA-OT installation. Every plug-in is controlled by a file named <filepath>plugin.xml</filepath>, which is
      located in the root directory of the plug-in.</p>

      <title>Plug-in benefits</title>
      <p>Plug-ins allow you to extend the toolkit in a way that is consistent, easy-to-share, and possible to preserve
        through toolkit upgrades.</p>
      <p>The DITA-OT plug-in mechanism provides the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plug-ins can easily be shared with other users, teams, or companies. Typically, all users need to do is to
          unzip and run a single installation command. With many builds, even that installation step is automatic.</li>
        <li>Plug-ins permit overrides or customizations to grow from simple to complex over time, with no increased
          complexity to the extension mechanism.</li>
        <li>Plug-ins can be moved from version to version of DITA-OT by reinstalling or copying the directory from one
          installation to another. There is no need to re-integrate code based on updates to DITA-OT core
          processing.</li>
        <li>Plug-ins can build upon each other. If you like a plug-in, simply install that plug-in, and then create your
          own plug-in that builds on top of it. The two plug-ins can then be distributed to your team as a unit, or you
          can share your own extensions with the original provider.</li>
      </ul>
