    by the toolkit and provides additional information that might be helpful in understanding and resolving the error

      >Each message ID is composed of a message prefix, a message number, and a letter that indicates the severity.</p>
      <p>The toolkit uses the following severity scale:</p>
      <dl id="severity-levels">
        <dlentry>
          <dt><codeph>INFO</codeph></dt>
          <dd><cite>Informational</cite> messages are indicated with the letter <codeph>I</codeph> at the end of the
            message ID. They highlight the progress of transformation and call attention to conditions of which you
            should be aware. For example, draft comments are enabled and will be rendered in the output.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><codeph>WARN</codeph></dt>
          <dd><cite>Warnings</cite> are issued when the toolkit encounters a problem that should be corrected.
            Processing will continue, but the output might not be as expected. Warnings are indicated with the letter
              <codeph>W</codeph> at the end of the message ID.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><codeph>ERROR</codeph></dt>
          <dd><cite>Error</cite> messages are issued when the toolkit encounters a more severe problem, and the output
            is affected. For example, some content is missing or invalid, or the content is not rendered in the output.
            Errors are indicated with the letter <codeph>E</codeph> at the end of the message ID.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><codeph>FATAL</codeph></dt>
          <dd><cite>Fatal</cite> errors appear when the toolkit encounters a severe condition, processing stops, and no
            output is generated. Fatal errors are indicated with the letter <codeph>F</codeph> at the end of the message
            ID.</dd>
