      <note>This topic provides a summary of changes in DITA-OT 3.2 that may require modifications to custom stylesheets
        or plug-ins. For more information on changes in this release, see the
        <xref keyref="3.2-release-notes"/>.</note>

      <title>Deprecated targets</title>
      <p>The <parmname>configuration-jar</parmname> Ant target used during the plug-in integration process has been
        deprecated and may be removed in an upcoming release. This was previously used to package additional
        configuration files and properties into <filepath>lib/dost-configuration.jar</filepath>, but recent versions of
        DITA-OT include the <filepath>config</filepath> directory in the classpath for this purpose, so the
        configuration JAR is no longer necessary.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Secure connections to the plug-in registry</title>
      <note type="attention">To ensure data integrity during the plug-in installation process, Transport Layer Security
        (TLS) will soon be required to access the plug-in registry. If you are using DITA-OT 3.2 or 3.2.1 and are unable
        to upgrade to the latest version, modify the <codeph>registry</codeph> key in the
          <filepath>config/configuration.properties</filepath> file to switch the URI schema to
          <codeph>http<b>s</b>://</codeph>, so the entry reads <codeph>https://plugins.dita-ot.org/</codeph>.</note>
