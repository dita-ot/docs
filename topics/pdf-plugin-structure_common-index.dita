  <title>Index configuration</title>
  <shortdesc>The <filepath>common/index</filepath> folder houses custom index definition files that override the
    standard definitions in <filepath>org.dita.pdf2/cfg/common/index</filepath>.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Each file contains data for a single language, and should take that language’s ISO 639-1 language designator as
      its name (for example, <filepath>pt.xml</filepath> for Portuguese). If necessary, locale-specific customizations
      can be provided by adding a region designator to the file name (for example, <filepath>pt_BR.xml</filepath> for
      Brazilian Portuguese).</p>
    <p>The index files consist of <xmlelement>index.group</xmlelement> elements which contain sorting information on one
      or more characters. Index groups are listed in sort order (“specials” before numbers, numbers before the letter
      ‘A‘, etc), and the <xmlelement>char.set</xmlelement> entries they contain are also listed in sort order (uppercase
      before lowercase).</p>
    <p>The best way to start editing a custom index file is by making a copy of the original from
        <filepath>org.dita.pdf2/cfg/common/index</filepath> and making changes as desired.</p>
    <p>In order to apply a custom index definition to your publishing outputs, edit <filepath>catalog.xml</filepath> and
      uncomment the appropriate entry in the “Index configuration override entries” section.</p>
