  <shortdesc>The <filepath>fo/i18n</filepath> folder houses custom internationalization files that override the standard
    configurations in <filepath>org.dita.pdf2/cfg/fo/i18n</filepath>.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>As with index configuration and variable overrides, each file contains data for a single language, and should
      take that language’s ISO 639-1 language designator as its name. </p>
    <p>Each configuration file contains mappings of certain symbols to the Unicode codepoint which should be used to
      represent them in the given locale.</p>
    <p>The best way to start editing a custom configuration is by making a copy of the original from
        <filepath>org.dita.pdf2/cfg/fo/i18n</filepath> and making changes as desired.</p>
    <p>In order to apply a custom configuration to your publishing outputs, edit <filepath>catalog.xml</filepath> and
      uncomment the appropriate entry in the “I18N configuration override entries” section.</p>
