  <title>DITA to troff</title>
  <shortdesc>The <option>troff</option> transformation produces output for use with the troff viewer on Unix-style
    platforms, particularly for programs such as the man page viewer.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>Each DITA topic generally produces one troff output file. The <option>troff</option> transformation supports most
      common DITA structures, but it does not support &lt;table&gt; or &lt;simpletable&gt; elements. Most testing of
      troff output was performed using the Cygwin Linux emulator.</p>
