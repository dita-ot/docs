      <title>Software required for core DITA-OT processing</title>
      <p>The DITA-OT requires the following software applications:
        <dl>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK), version <keyword
                keyref="tool.java.version"/> or later</dt>
            <dd>Provides the basic environment for the DITA-OT. You can download the Oracle JRE or JDK from <xref
                keyref="download.oracle-jdk"/>. <note>This is the <i>only</i> prerequisite software that you need to
                install. The remaining required software is included in the distribution package.</note></dd>

            <dt>Apache Ant</dt>
            <dd>Provides the standard setup and sequencing of processing steps. DITA-OT includes Ant version <keyword

          <dlentry>
            <dt>XSLT processor</dt>
            <dd>Provides the main transformation services. It must be compliant with XSLT 2.0. DITA-OT includes Saxon
              version <keyword keyref="tool.saxon.version"/>. You can download Saxon from <xref keyref="download.saxon"

          <dlentry>
            <dt>ICU for Java</dt>
            <dd><draft-comment author="Kristen James Eberlein" time="11 August 2012">Does the DITA-OT only use ICU for
                Java for index processing? Index processing is what is explicitly mentioned in the installing
                topics.</draft-comment>ICU for Java is a cross-platform, Unicode-based, globalization library. It
              includes support for comparing locale-sensitive strings; formatting dates, times, numbers, currencies, and
              messages; detecting text boundaries; and converting character sets. You can download ICU for Java from
                <xref keyref="download.icu4j"/>.</dd>
